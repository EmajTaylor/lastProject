Testimonial

Emaj: Hello, Iâ€™m Emaj Taylor. I came into this class with a hope and a dream of opening up new doors in a field of work I already felt myself leaning towards. Not only was I terribly mistaken about the details of the job, I felt myself getting way over my head in work! But as my instructor Mr. Lok Shankar introduced himself and the nature of his work clearly and concisely,  I felt more  assured than ever to study something that I happen to have a passion for, and even to find my own unique way of expressing it! I am very thankful for this opportunity, and would encourage others to be inspired to take the same leap of faith in trying a new career path!
