          Web development is a dynamic and multifaceted field dedicated to the
          creation and maintenance of websites and web applications. It
          encompasses a range of disciplines, including front-end development,
          which focuses on designing and implementing the visual and interactive
          aspects of a site, and back-end development, which involves building
          and managing the server-side infrastructure that powers these sites.
        </p>

        <p>
          As technology continues to evolve, web developers must stay abreast of
          new tools, languages, and frameworks to deliver user-friendly,
          responsive, and efficient digital experiences. Whether it's crafting a
          sleek, responsive design or optimizing complex data interactions, web
          development plays a crucial role in shaping how we interact with the
          digital world.
        </p>

        <p>
          Web development is the process of creating, building, and maintaining

        During this seven week period we have been going through an introductory
        course for web development led by Mr Lok. This course has given me and
        my classmates a better insight on what web developers actually do on the
        day to day bases. We have explored and learned a plethra of topics
        including : HTML , CSS, JavaScript, Pseudo Elements and many more.

      <h1>What is Web Development?</h1>
      <p>
        At its core, web development is the process of creating and maintaining
        websites. It encompasses everything from designing the layout and
        functionality of a website to ensuring it runs smoothly and efficiently.
        Think of it as building a house; web development involves designing the
        blueprint, constructing the structure, and ensuring everything functions
        as it should.
      </p>

      <h1>The Importance of Web Development</h1>
      <p>
        In today’s digital age, a strong online presence is crucial for
        businesses, organizations, and individuals alike. Websites are often the
        first point of contact between a company and its customers, making web
        development a critical skill for anyone looking to make an impact
        online.
      </p>

      <h1>Key Areas of Web Development</h1>

      <h3>Front-End Development:</h3>
      <p>
        This is the part of web development that users interact with directly.
        It involves creating the visual aspects of a website—the layout, colors,
        fonts, and buttons. Technologies used in front-end development include
        HTML (HyperText Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and
        JavaScript.
      </p>
      <h3>Back-End Development:</h3>
      <p>
        This is the server-side of web development. It’s all about managing and
        manipulating the data that drives a website. Back-end developers work
        with databases, server logic, and application programming interfaces
        (APIs). Common languages used here include Python, Ruby, PHP, and
        Node.js.
      </p>
      <h3>Full-Stack Development:</h3>
      <p>
        Full-stack developers are versed in both front-end and back-end
        technologies. They have a comprehensive understanding of how the entire
        website functions, from the user interface to the server-side processes.

        <li>Design: Creating the layout and user experience.</li>
        <li>Development: Writing the code and building the site.</li>
        <li>Testing: Ensuring everything works as expected.</li>
        <li>Deployment: Launching the website for the public to use.</li>
        <li>Maintenance: Updating and fixing issues as needed.</li>
        <li>
          Emerging Trends possibilities that web development has to offer.
